## Intro
This project is a custom implementation of MaterialSearchView.

The main reasons I had to create this project are:
* Show a search bar without action or toolbar.
* Show a prefix in search field, i.e.: "Issue# 'xx'" where 'xx' is the text you can enter to search and 'Issue#' is the prefix.
* Set a max length for the search field.

If you don't need any of these features, probably you are not in the right place. Please, take a look to the native one or other public repositories which I based my code:

-  https://github.com/Mauker1/MaterialSearchView
- and some more...
